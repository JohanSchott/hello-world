# hello-world
This project is for me to learn how to use git.
First I'll clone the github version to my local version: `git clone https://github.com/JohanSchott/hello-world.git`
Then edit a bit in the README.md file.
After that, update the local version: `git add README.md` and `git commit -m "update master README"`.
Now I update the remote version: `git push origin master`
Then locally create a new branch: `git checkout -b [name_of_your_new_branch]`
Push this local branch to github: `git push origin [name_of_your_new_branch]`
